[University of Central Florida](http://www.ist.ucf.edu/grad/)
This is the framework for homework #3. 

The assignment is due: **Monday, April  24 at 11:59PM (EST)**

I will be using **two late days** (my last late day and the one additional late day from Joe)

# Introduction
The goal of this assignment is to enable the behavioral animation of vehicle-like walking agents. 

You will be expected to compose a *final report* which demonstrates your understanding on the material in each section of the assignment. Be visual! - Pictures say a thousand words so you do not have to. Show off your different configurations and really explore the assignment.


### Part 1: Behaviors

The goal of this assignment is to enable the steering behavioral animation of agents.

We represent an agent as a two-dimensional disk with mass (**m**) and moment-of-inertia (**I**) that is capable of generating a force **F** along body x-axis with a torque about the z-axis. For this assignment assume that the agent only translates in the world x-y plane and rotates about the body z-axis.

**(a) - 10 points** : Compute derivative vector given input and state vectors. Implement the function *SIMAgent::FindDeriv()*. This function sets derive vector to appropriate values after being called.

Description of agent state vector and input vector:  
* state[0] is the position of the agent in local body coordinates (almost useless in this project);  
* state[1] is the orientation angle of the agent with respect to world (i.e. global) coordinates;  
* state[2] is the velocity of the agent  in local body coordinates.  
* state[3] is the angular velocity of the agent in world coordinates. 
* input[0] is the force in local body coordinates;  
* input[1] is the torque in local body coordinates

You will need to set deriv[0], deriv[1], deriv[2], deriv[3]. Compute derivative vector given input and state vectors. This function sets derive vector to appropriate values after being called. 
* deriv[0] is the velocity of the agent  in local body coordinates
* deriv[1] is the angular velocity of the agent in world coordinates
* deriv[2] is the force in local body coordinates divided by the mass.
* deriv[3] is the torque in local body coordinates divided by the inertia.

You also must implement *SIMAgent::InitValues()*: Try to figure out appropriate values for control and behavior settings. You need to find out appropriate values for: *SIMAgent::Kv0, SIMAgent::Kp1, SIMAgent::Kv1, SIMAgent::KArrival, SIMAgent::KDeparture,
SIMAgent::KNoise,	SIMAgent::KWander, SIMAgent::KAvoid, SIMAgent::TAvoid, SIMAgent::RNeighborhood, SIMAgent::KSeparate, SIMAgent::KAlign, SIMAgent::KCohesion.*


**(b) - 20 points**: In this part of the assignment you will need to implement 6 types of individual behaviors and 5 types of group behaviors. Create the following behaviors through appropriate computation of V<sub> d</sub>  and θ<sub>d</sub>  commands:
* Seek
* Flee
* Arrival
* Departure
* Wander
* Obstacle Avoidance

**(c) - 20 points**: Implement the functions for the following group behaviors: 
* Seperation
* Cohesion 
* Alignment 
* Flocking
* Leader Following

# Part 2 - Simulating a simple pedestrian flow

The goal of this part of the assigment is to simulate the pedestrain flow for various configurations. Pedestrian traffic simulation is an important, sometimes required, stage for certain construction projects such as shopping centers, airports, railway stations, or stadiums. hese analyses can be used by architects in the design stage, by facilities owners contemplating changes, by city planners to evaluate rush hours, or even by civil authorities to simulate evacuations or other emergencies. 

**(a) - 0 points**: Follow the Anylogic example for the [Subway Entrance example](https://help.anylogic.com/index.jsp?topic=/com.xj.anylogic.help/html/_PL/tutorial/Subway_Entrance.html). Create the appropriate [boundaries and walls](https://help.anylogic.com/index.jsp?topic=/com.xj.anylogic.help/html/markup/Wall.html), and the display ther pedestrian density map, [statistics](https://help.anylogic.com/index.jsp?nav=/4_1_5), [2D and 3D animations](https://help.anylogic.com/index.jsp?topic=/com.xj.anylogic.help/html/_PL/reference/Animation.html).

* ANSWER: Above is my subway entrance example. I found the tutorial very helpful in learning the fundamentals of Anylogic (hopefully seen below as well). The pedestrians enter the subway and line up in one of six lines. Once they've reached a line, one pedestrian will be allowed to enter the train per line per second. The rate at which people enter the subway and board the train are parallel, with a slight offset on the boarding lines due to the pedestrians having to stop and wait in line.

**(b) - 20 points**: Create a maze. Generate the pdm, stats, and animations like before. Vary [parameters in your agents](https://help.anylogic.com/index.jsp?topic=/com.xj.anylogic.help/html/_PL/reference/Attributes.html) to give them different behaviors and show the pedistrians change how they navigate the maze.

![](images/MazeImages/mazeRoute.png?raw=true)

* ANSWER: Above is my maze along with its pdm, stats, and 3D animation. There are four paths, four dead ends, and one split in the maze. The first image shows the pedestrian logic(not just any logic ;D) over its location in the maze. The second image shows the four paths in the maze.

**(c) - 30 points**: Model and analyze a building (or floor/outdoor space/stadium) on campus. (There is help on piazza how to find rough building plans - we expect something plausible). Create a senario: evacuation, daily office routine, special event, normal egress.... etc., and model and design your own experiment to determine if the building design suits the needs of its users. Start with photographs of your site, describe your site, describe your senario and hypothesis. Then use an agent-based pedistrian simulation to visualize your experiment's results.

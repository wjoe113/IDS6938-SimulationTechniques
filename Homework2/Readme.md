# Introduction
A Discrete-event Model simulates a complex system as an ordered sequence of well-defined events. Mathematically Discrete-event models use Markov Processes, Queuing systems, events, probability / statistics, and random variables. The purpose of this assignment is to learn the mathematical foundations, how to program these models, and how to simulate them. The assignment is due Tuesday, March 28, 2017 at 11:59 P.M.

Major parts for the Assignment
You can think of the assignment broken up to 4 major parts:
* Empirical Tests of Randomness
* Snakes and Ladders (Discrete Event Markov Chains and Monte Carlo Simulations)
* Discrete Event Simulation - Queue Simulation
* Composing a final report

The goal of this assignment is to become familiar with the concepts in the second third of the class. You will be expected to compose a *final report* which demonstrates your understanding on the material in each section of the assignment. Be visual! - Pictures say a thousand words so you do not have to. Show off your different configurations and really explore the assignment.

# Assignment
## Part 1: Empirical Tests of Randomness (20 pts).
**(a) - 3pts:** Output the results of five different random number engines, using a uniform distribution for values between [0-100]. Generate useful charts and statistics from the output to analyze how uniform these values truly are. You are expected to look at some advanced statistics and test, for example: tests like the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, Chi-square test, Autocorrelation test, and Spearmanâ€™s Rank Correlation Coefficient are a few examples of ones your could use.)

**(b) - 2pts:**  Vary *N* (amount of samples). How do things change.

| N = 500 | Part1b |

| ![](images/part1b/Sobol500.png?raw=true) | ![](images/part1b/p1busefulstats.png?raw=true) |

* ANSWER: I made N = 500 for part1b. The variances for N = 500 were slightly larger than for N = 100000 but everything else pretty much stayed the same (mean, stdev). The median, min, max, and range changed as expected because these are randomly generated. The higher N the more chances a smaller min and larger max can be generated.

**(c) - 3pts:** Fix a random engine of your choice from part (a), and now vary five different [distributions](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/random/) for just the psedo-random numbers. Again, analyze your results with graphs and statistics of choice.

**(d)- 4pts:** Generate random numbers in two-dimensions for a unit square. Plot the results for the different random number engines. The vertical axis should vary N in increasing order. The horizontal axis should show of the random number engines.

**(e)- 4pts:** Generate random numbers in two-dimensions for a unit square. Plot the results for the different distributions. The vertical axis should vary N in increasing order. The horizontal axis should show of the random number engines. (See [Random Numbers Webcourse page](https://webcourses.ucf.edu/courses/1246518/pages/random-numbers?module_item_id=10541423) for a rough idea what you should produce.)

* ANSWER: All graphs and charts are in the excel sheets stored in the image folder for each part. The text files from running the programs are in the Discrete2 folder.

## Part 2 - Snakes and Ladders (Discrete Event Markov Chains and Monte Carlo Simulations) (30 pts)
**(a) Null State Game transition matrix - 10pts:** The *null state game* is defined by a game with no snakes and no ladders. This simplifies the game to just the moves of the two dice rolls. Create the transition matrix for the null state game. The Transition Matrix would be decided by the roll of a fair, six-sided die, so it would start to look like: From state 0 it is equally probable of landing on squares 1-6. From state 1 t is equally probable of landing on squares 2-7, and so on. Create this transition matrix. The end is trickier, we will consider any roll past 100 a win case. (Opposed to rolling exactly onto square 100.) Confirm you have a well formed stochastic matrix (Write checks for confirming each row of T sums to one and all elements are non-negative). The Transition Matrix methods can be found in the TransitionMatrix.h file.

* ANSWER: Everything works!

| Null State Game |

| ![](images/part2b/p2aproof.png?raw=true) |

**(b) Simulate and analyze the results of Null State Game - 10pts:** What is the modal number of moves required by a single player to finish the game? We will be simulating the game two different ways. **(1) Markov Chain**: The game can be analyzed with a row vector, *v* with 101 components, representing the probabilities that the player is on each of the positions. V(0) is (1,0,0,...,0) since we know we start at square 0. v evolves by: For this part (1) use the *Markov project* in the Snake and Ladders starter code.<BR> **(2) Monte Carlo:** he will will use a monte carlo process to solve our Discrete Time Markov Chains. Here (2) use the DTMC project, and utilize the DTMC method similar to what we did in class. <BR><BR>Produce graphs to analyze the results and show how the game evolves over time for both methods. Plot useful statistics of the results such as percentage chance of finishing the game in n-moves, cumulative probability of finishing the game in n-moves, and other ways to convey useful information of the results.

* ANSWER: The modal number of moves required by a single player to finish the game is 42. Just kidding, but no not really... Using the Markov Chain we can expect to see our first likelihood of winning at 18 rolls. However, by likelihood I mean you'd have a 1.01024e-11 likelihood of winning. But no worries, by roll 44 you'd be guaranteed a win. See graphs and output below. Using the DTMC method we can expect to see our first win around 25 rolls and win in ever game after around 32 rolls. The DTMC null state graph below shows where each game ended after 25 rolls. You can see one game made it to the finish. You can see the results below in the Markov graph.

**(c) Simulate and analyze the results of Snakes and Ladders -10pts:**  Construct a new transition matrix based on the table:

Ladders From  | Ladders To | |  Snakes From  | Snakes To 
-------- | -------- | ------------- | -------- | -------- 
3|19| |11|7
15|37| |18|13
22|42| |28|12
25|64| |36|34
41|73| |77|16
53|74| |47|26
63|86| |83|39
76|91| |92|75
84|98| |99|70

Run the same simulation and analyze your results similar to part (b) for the proper game of *Snakes and Ladders* for both methods. How often are the snakes and ladders used, how do the probability of finishing change, etc? What is the maximum and expected amount of moves for the game? Use charts and graphs to illustrate these points.

* ANSWER: Everything Works! As seen below, because of the snakes and ladders, there is no definite possibilty of finishing. The Markov graph shows that even after 100 rolls the probability of finishing is still not 100%. The DTMC graph shows where players ended after 100 rolls, with only two players making it to the end. For Markov, as you increase the amount of rolls you approach a 92% probability of reaching the end. With DTMC you can expect to hit the end eventually, but there is no definite amount of rolls where you can expect to reach the end.

**(d) Think - 10pts:** If these games are built entirely on chance, do they require any strategy? Is it really a *game*, would you rather play games of chance or games of strategy?

* ANSWER: Even if strategy (blowing on dice, shaking hand, etc.) is introduced in to Snakes and Ladders, it will not alter the outcome. For example, blowing on dice does not increase the probability of it landing on a particular side (unless you want to account for the wind resistance and weight of your spit). Therefore if a game is only a game if strategy is involved, then games like Snakes and Ladders and I Declare War are not games. They are entertaining exercise of chance (and very long homework assignments - I'm not bitter). See the markov_results.txt, markov_results_wins.txt, dtmc_results.txt, and excel sheets (image folder) for more information.

## Part 3 - Discrete Event Simulation - Queue Simulation (30 pts)

**(a) - 4pts:** To start create the senario in the figure above in *main.cpp*. Checkin will have a *mu* of 53 and accept new arrivals, the security gates will have a *mu* of 20, and will not accept new arrivials, boarding will have a *mu* of 80. You will have to set up  the appropriate *MM1_Queue* objects to capture the functionality above.

| main.cpp |
| ------------- |
| ![](images/part3/p3acode.png?raw=true) |

**(b) - 4pts:** You want to add a check that your process is within an error range *is_within_error_range(float)* where the error range will be 0.002. You also want to process the next event, and add an external arrival where marked.

| main.cpp, is_within_error_range(0.002) |
| ------------- |
| ![](images/part3/p3bcode.png?raw=true) |

**(c) - 3pts:** in *mm1_queue.cpp* : add code to caculate the expected results for: 
  *  expected_server_utilization 
  *    expected idle prob
  *   expected queue length 
  *  expected number customers 
  * expected waiting time
  * expected response time 

| mm1_queue.cpp |
| ------------- |
| ![](images/part3/p3ccode.png?raw=true) |

**(d) - 4pts:** Write code to call the functions to output and generate data from the airport senario. Plot and analyze the useful statistics/results in the program of your choice.  (Hint -  basically call  *.output();* on the MM1_Queue objects you create. Hint2 - two other use functions are *get_current_time()* and  *plot_results_output()* call intially on your intial MM1_Queue object.)  

* ANSWER: From the graphs below we can see how the simulation performed each task compared to the expected performance of that task. For example, the number of customers was higher than expected a majority of the time, and the wait time was around average (for once). Data collected can be found in the queues build folder.

## Part 4 - Implementing Extra Features (10 pts)
Implementing 2 features on the extra features list. Pick any feature on the "*extra features*" list below to customize your assignment to fit your interests. Please document this in your writeup. (*Note: These should total 10pts. You could successfully implement a feature worth 10pts or greater. This also fulfills this requirement. The features are assigned points based on difficulty. The 5pt features are more straightforward.*)

The extra features completed in this project include:
* (10 Points) - Add a 2D visualization to AnyLogic for Part 3.
* (10 Points) - Add a 3D visualization to AnyLogic for Part 3.
* (20 Points) - Complete Part 2 with a 3D version of Snakes and Ladders. Construct the game's transition matrix, simulate the game, and analyze the results. See below.

## Part 5 - Final Report (10 pts)
Write up the results to the previous sections in the main *readme.md* in your forked repository. Turn in the URL for your fork in webcourses. Be visual. The report should contain the graphs and analysis requested. I have high expectations for the documentation here and you should allot the proper time to compose the writeup.

* ANSWER: This readme is the final report for the homework. All supporting files including excel sheets, code, and pictures can be found in the Homework2 folder (somewhere). Special thanks to everyone who aided me in each part. It'd be a shorter list if I listed who didn't aid me in some way. Also, special thanks to the many Disney soundtracks that got me through numerous nights of coding. I listened to so many songs YouTube stopped recommending them on my home page. Look for the 3D game below. Thank you for reading!

## Extra Features (Extra Credit - 25pts)
You have to implement two features from this list for Part 4. You may choose any two features you wish from this list. (Please explicitly note them in your *Readme.md*) If you feel like going beyond the scope of the assignment, you should consider implementing more of the following extra features. *Get the assignment working without them first.* You can get a maximum of 25 points in extra credit. Simply implementing these things doesn't guarantee you a 25; you really need to go above and beyond to get the full amount. (*The instructor reserves the right to hand out extra credit as his he sees fit.*)

* ANSWER: Here are some pictures of the 3D Snakes and Ladders Game I made in Unity. The game plays by the player rolling a die to move their piece. The piece highlights it's current tile in blue and all possible tiles in yellow. The higher the probability of the player landing on a spot, the darker the yellow square (yellow = 1/6, dark yellow = 1/3, red = 1, see images 3 and 4). The player's previous roll and total rolls are displayed above the roll die button in the lower right corner of the screen. If the player lands on a ladder they will climb up the ladder (never down, that is unsafe). Inversely, if the player lands on a snake they will slide down to the end of the snake. This game closely simulates Markov's chain, in that it is possible to never win the game. Each roll is random, therefore there is no strategy and no guarentee of winning. Code is in 3D Game folder in SnakesAndLadders folder. YouTube demo coming soon. Have fun!
